    <!-- System Overview -->
    <div class="description">
        <h2>System Overview</h2>
        <p>This Restaurant Management System integrates various essential functionalities for restaurant operations, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow. Below is a brief explanation of the core features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customer Queue Management:</strong> Manages the order in which customers are served, ensuring that no one is skipped or left waiting too long, optimizing service time.</li>
            <li><strong>Table Reservation System:</strong> Allows customers to reserve tables in advance, ensuring there is no double-booking, and providing a smooth dining experience by managing available tables effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Tracks the availability of food ingredients, supplies, and other essential items, ensuring that stock levels are maintained and orders are replenished in time.</li>
            <li><strong>Menu Management:</strong> Allows restaurant staff to manage the food and beverage menu, keeping track of dishes and prices. It integrates with the billing system to update menu items for the customers in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>Billing System:</strong> Generates bills for customers based on the menu items ordered, calculates total prices, applies taxes or discounts, and processes payment efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Delivery Management:</strong> Manages orders that are placed for delivery, tracking their progress and ensuring timely dispatch, improving customer satisfaction for delivery-based services.</li>
            <li><strong>Lodging System:</strong> Handles room bookings for guests staying at the restaurant’s associated lodging facilities. It tracks availability, booking dates, and guest information.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Menu and Inventory System -->
    <div class="description">
        <h2>Menu and Inventory Management</h2>
        <p>I was responsible for creating the Menu and Inventory Management parts of the system. These functionalities are integral to the smooth operation of the restaurant and play a crucial role in ensuring that items are readily available for customers and that stock levels are kept up to date.</p>

        <h3>Menu Management</h3>
        <p>The Menu Management system enables restaurant staff to add, remove, or update menu items. It allows the restaurant to manage various categories, such as appetizers, main courses, desserts, and drinks. By using the system, restaurant staff can easily modify prices, descriptions, and availability of dishes in real-time. This feature ensures that the menu displayed to customers is always up to date and reflects any changes in offerings.</p>

        <h3>Inventory Management</h3>
        <p>The Inventory Management system keeps track of all the ingredients, supplies, and items in the restaurant. It updates inventory levels as customers place orders and ensures the stock levels are properly maintained. The system alerts staff when items are running low and need to be replenished. This reduces the chances of running out of essential ingredients and ensures smooth service without disruptions. Additionally, it integrates with the billing system to make sure that any changes in inventory are reflected in the menu's item availability and pricing.</p>

    <!-- Learning Outcomes -->
    <div class="description">
        <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System Design:</strong> I learned how to design and implement a cohesive system that integrates multiple functionalities, each playing a key role in the restaurant’s operations. This helped me understand how to connect different modules, such as inventory, billing, and customer management, into one unified platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong> Throughout the project, I deepened my knowledge of object-oriented programming principles, especially in designing classes and handling real-world data with structures like queues and maps for reservations and customer management.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong> Implementing algorithms like FIFO for queue management and using hash maps for efficient table reservation management enhanced my understanding of data structures and how they can be used in real-world applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Database and Real-Time Data Handling:</strong> The project enhanced my understanding of database management concepts, particularly in keeping real-time data consistent across multiple systems, like updating stock levels and billing after every order.</li>
            <li><strong>User Interface Design:</strong> I learned the importance of creating a user-friendly interface that is easy to use under pressure, especially in fast-paced environments like restaurants. This taught me how to focus on user needs and simplify complex processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem-Solving and Debugging:</strong> By dealing with complex scenarios, such as preventing double bookings in the reservation system or maintaining accurate inventory counts, I learned valuable problem-solving skills. I also gained experience in debugging and testing to ensure smooth functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> This project helped me develop time management skills by breaking down tasks into smaller pieces and working systematically to complete different components of the system. It taught me how to prioritize features and meet deadlines efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Collaboration (If applicable):</strong> If this was a team project, I would highlight the importance of collaboration and how we worked together to merge our individual parts into one comprehensive system. Even though I focused on menu and inventory, I coordinated with others to ensure seamless integration of all components.</li>
