<div class="container">
    <!-- System Overview -->
    <div class="description">
        <h2>System Overview</h2>
        <p>This Restaurant Management System is designed to streamline various operations in a restaurant. It handles customer queues, table reservations, inventory tracking, and order processing, aiming to optimize both customer experience and operational efficiency.</p>
        <p>The key features of the system include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer Queue Management</li>
            <li>Table Reservation System</li>
            <li>Inventory Management</li>
            <li>Menu and Billing System</li>
            <li>Delivery Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By integrating these systems into one cohesive platform, the Restaurant Management System ensures that tasks are handled smoothly, reducing wait times, optimizing table usage, and maintaining accurate records.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Customer Queue Management -->
    <div class="description">
        <h2>Customer Queue Management</h2>
        <p>The Customer Queue Management feature ensures that customers are served in the order they arrive. It uses a FIFO (First In, First Out) approach, guaranteeing that no customer is skipped or left waiting too long. This system helps in managing the customer flow and improving service efficiency.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Table Reservation System -->
    <div class="description">
        <h2>Table Reservation System</h2>
        <p>The Table Reservation System allows customers to book tables in advance, ensuring that there is no confusion about table availability. The system keeps track of reserved and available tables, preventing double-booking and ensuring a smooth dining experience. The algorithm used ensures efficient handling of table reservations by checking availability before confirming bookings, and automatically updating table status once the customer is seated.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Inventory Management -->
    <div class="description">
        <h2>Inventory Management</h2>
        <p>The Inventory Management system plays a crucial role in maintaining an optimal stock level within the restaurant. It tracks the supplies, ingredients, and items required to run day-to-day operations. This functionality ensures that restaurant managers are informed of stock levels and can make timely orders to replenish items before they run out. This reduces food waste and minimizes shortages that could affect service.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Menu and Billing System -->
    <div class="description">
        <h2>Menu and Billing System</h2>
        <p>The Menu and Billing system is designed to simplify the customer ordering and payment process. It allows customers to browse the restaurant's menu, place orders efficiently, and generate bills for each customer. The system automatically calculates the total price, applying any applicable taxes or discounts. This feature is integrated with the inventory to adjust stock levels after each order, ensuring the menu reflects accurate availability of items.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Learning Outcomes -->
    <div class="description">
        <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Throughout the development of this Restaurant Management System, I gained a wealth of knowledge and practical experience. One of the key learning outcomes was understanding the importance of system design and how various components need to interact seamlessly to create an efficient workflow. I learned how to integrate customer management, reservations, and billing systems into a unified platform. The project sharpened my skills in object-oriented programming, allowing me to better structure and organize code for readability and scalability.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I deepened my understanding of algorithms and data structures. For example, implementing the FIFO algorithm for the customer queue and managing reservations using hash maps gave me hands-on experience with real-world applications of these concepts. I also developed a strong understanding of database management, as the system relied on efficient data storage for tracking tables, reservations, and inventory levels.</p>
        <p>Working on the inventory and menu management system further enhanced my problem-solving skills. I had to design a system that could accurately track stock levels, integrate seamlessly with the billing process, and prevent discrepancies in the inventory data. This project helped me realize the importance of maintaining accurate data flow in real-time systems and the impact that small errors can have on operational efficiency.</p>
        <p>In addition to technical skills, this project also taught me the significance of user experience (UX) design. I focused on creating an intuitive interface that would be easy to use for restaurant staff. This involved considering user needs, minimizing complexity, and ensuring that the system could be operated efficiently in a fast-paced environment.</p>
        <p>Finally, this project strengthened my overall programming and project management abilities. I learned how to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks and effectively manage time to meet deadlines. The experience taught me the value of testing and debugging, ensuring that each feature works as expected and handles edge cases appropriately.</p>
