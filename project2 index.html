<h2>Reflections on Problem-Solving and Design</h2>
            <p><strong>How do you determine the most efficient approach when solving a complex problem?</strong><br>
            I begin by analyzing the problem's limitations and considering various solutions. After evaluating their time complexity, space usage, and practicality, I choose the most suitable method. Running tests with sample cases helps refine and perfect the chosen approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflect on a situation where you need to balance multiple conflicting constraints in a design. What approach did you take?</strong><br>
            In these cases, I focus on the most important constraints, considering their impact and feasibility. I test different options repeatedly to find a solution that meets the key needs while making adjustments on less important details.</p>

            <p><strong>What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</strong><br>
            Effectiveness is judged by how accurate, efficient, scalable, and satisfying the solution is for users. It's also important to make sure the solution meets all the problem's requirements.</p>

            <p><strong>How can you adapt an existing solution to address a new or unforeseen challenge?</strong><br>
            Adapting means looking at the new challenge, finding similarities with the current solution, and changing or expanding it to fit the new needs. This usually involves making the solution more flexible and easier to modify.</p>

            <p><strong>What strategies do you use to identify patterns or structures in complex datasets or problems?</strong><br>
            Strategies involve looking at data visually, finding patterns through statistics, and breaking the problem into smaller parts. Using methods like grouping and pattern detection helps find important structures.</p>

            <p><strong>How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over optimization in a solution?</strong><br>
            Simplicity is preferred when it's more important for the solution to be clear and easy to maintain than to make it highly optimized, especially when performance differences are small or time is limited.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflect on how breaking down a problem into smaller components can help you approach it more effectively.</strong><br>
            Breaking a problem into smaller parts makes it easier to focus on each piece. This approach helps in understanding the problem, fixing issues, and allows different parts to be developed at the same time.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflect on the trade-offs while choosing between different approaches to solve a problem.</strong><br>
            Trade-offs are evaluated by looking at things like speed, scalability, complexity, and resource needs. The decision is based on which factors best match the problem's goals and limits.</p>

            <p><strong>How do you identify and address potential limitations or weaknesses in a proposed solution?</strong><br>
            Limitations are found through testing, peer feedback, and examining extreme cases. Solving them requires continuous improvements, using feedback, and exploring different methods or technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflect on how applying knowledge from one context can help you solve a problem in a different context.</strong><br>
            Using knowledge from one area means understanding the core principles and creatively applying them in a new context. Thinking across different fields leads to innovative solutions and improves the ability to solve problems in various ways.</p>

            <p><strong>How do you decide when to innovate versus relying on tried-and-tested solutions?</strong><br>
            Whether to innovate or use existing solutions depends on the complexity of the problem, my willingness to take risks, and the resources at hand. I choose to innovate when current solutions are not enough and stick to reliable methods when they are suitable.</p>
