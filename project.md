# **SARNATH CITY DESIGN**
# Introduction
The Design and Analysis of Algorithms course delves into the principles of creating efficient algorithms to tackle real-world challenges. It encompasses essential concepts such as recursion, iteration, backtracking, and dynamic programming, alongside the application of data structures like trees, graphs, and heaps to address complex problems across various fields.

This course bridges the gap between algorithmic theory and practical implementation, demonstrating its relevance in areas such as optimizing transportation routes and managing large-scale business datasets.

# Course Project Overview
The project centers on identifying and addressing inefficiencies in urban planning that necessitate engineering solutions. Based on findings from a white paper, the problem domain includes challenges in traffic flow, waste management, and infrastructure design. Each team member is tasked with analyzing specific business cases and proposing algorithm-driven solutions to mitigate these issues effectively.

# Overview
A smart city is a concept that incorporates advanced technology and digital solutions to improve the quality of life for its residents while enhancing sustainability, efficiency, and accessibility. For a city known for tourism, a smart tourism city integrates these technologies to provide a seamless experience for visitors, alongside supporting local infrastructure and services.
1. Residential Areas (35-40%)
Area: 525 - 600 sq km
2. Commercial and Business Districts (15-20%)
Area: 225 - 300 sq km
3. Industrial Zones (10-15%)
Area: 150 - 225 sq km
4. Green Spaces and Parks (10-15%)
Area: 150 - 225 sq km
5. Transportation and Infrastructure (10-15%)
Area: 150 - 225 sq km
6. Utilities and Energy Infrastructure (5-10%)
Area: 75 - 150 sq km
7. Education and Healthcare (5-10%)
Area: 75 - 150 sq km
8. Cultural and Social Spaces (5-10%)
Area: 75 - 150 sq km
9. Other Miscellaneous Areas (1-5%)
Area: 15 - 75 sq km

# BUDGET
The initial budget for transforming a 1,500 sq km city into a smart city ranges from $20 billion to $45 billion, depending on factors like infrastructure, technology integration, and sustainability. Key expenditures include smart roads, energy systems, IoT infrastructure, and public services, along with development of residential and commercial spaces. The budget can vary based on regional conditions, government support, and the city's technology ambitions.

# SUSTAINABILITY
1)Solar powered street lights
2)Electric roads for transportation
3)Hybrid boats (solar/electric)
4)Hydropower plants
5)Sewage treatmennt
6)30% green spaces
